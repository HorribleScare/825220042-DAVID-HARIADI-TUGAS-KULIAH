# 🎓 College Tourism Web Project Source Code
This repository contains the source code and supporting files for the Tourism Web Application developed by David Hariadi as part of college assignment requirements. The project includes multiple PHP files and database components designed to demonstrate web application logic, data handling, and interface interactions. The codebase is structured to reflect real-world development practices such as modular includes, dynamic pages, and user interaction logic—making it a solid demonstration of both server-side programming and application design.

## 📦 Contents
This project includes:
- Multiple PHP pages for managing tourism modules:
  - Destinations
  - Hotels
  - Restaurants
  - Events
  - News
- Search and category filtering pages
- Header and footer includes for consistent UI
- Database SQL file (`a_wisata.sql`) for sample dataset
- Supporting assets (CSS, JS, images)

The project showcases how web application logic and UI components can be organized in a structured repository.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- PHP (Server-Side Logic)
- MySQL (Database Management)
- HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript (Frontend Layout)
- Modular includes for reusable header and footer

This combination was used to build dynamic server-rendered pages and handle user interactions effectively.

## 🚀 Features
- Clean PHP project structure
- Multiple modules for tourism data management
- Search and category filtering functionality
- Reusable header and footer includes for consistent UI
- Easily extensible for further tourism-related development

## 🔍 Project Overview
The project was developed as part of college coursework and contains practical examples of how web applications are structured using PHP and MySQL. Each page demonstrates a specific aspect of web programming, from UI layout to backend logic for handling data and user interaction. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and expansion of the application.
